2. Product Description
ETAP is a fully graphical electrical power system analysis program that runs on Microsoft® Windows®
2008 R2 (SP1), 2012/R2, 7 (SP1), 8/8.1, 10 operating systems. In addition to the standard offline
simulation modules, ETAP can utilize real-time operating data for advanced monitoring, real-time
simulation, optimization, and high-speed intelligent load shedding. However, only offline simulation
modules are included in the ETAP 14.0.0 Demo.

ETAP has been designed and developed by engineers for engineers to handle the diverse discipline of
power systems in one integrated package with multiple interface views such as AC and DC networks,
cable raceways, ground grid, GIS, panels, protective device
coordination/selectivity, and AC and DC control system diagrams.
ETAP allows you to work directly with graphical one-line diagrams,
underground cable raceway systems, three-dimensional cable systems, advanced
time-current coordination and selectivity plots, geographic information system
schematics (GIS), as well as three-dimensional ground grid systems. The
program has been designed according to three key concepts:

Operation Technology, Inc.

Analysis Capabilities

Virtual Reality Operation
The program operation resembles real electrical system operation as closely as possible. For example,
when you open or close a circuit breaker, place an element out of service, or change the operating status
of motors, the de-energized elements and subsystems are indicated on the one-line diagram in gray. ETAP
incorporates new concepts for determining protective device coordination directly from the one-line
diagram.

Total Integration of Data
ETAP combines the electrical, logical, mechanical, and physical attributes of system elements in the same
database. For example, a cable not only contains data representing its electrical properties and physical
dimensions, but also information indicating the raceways through which it is routed. Thus, the data for a
single cable can be used for load flow or short-circuit analyses (which require electrical parameters and
connections) as well as cable ampacity derating calculations (which require physical routing data). This
integration of the data provides consistency throughout the system and eliminates multiple data entry for
the same element.

Simplicity in Data Entry
ETAP keeps track of the detailed data for each electrical apparatus. Data editors can speed up the data
entry process by requiring the minimum data for a particular study. To achieve this, we have structured
the property editors in the most logical manner for entering data for different types of analysis or design.
ETAP’s one-line diagram supports a number of features to assist you in constructing networks of varying
complexities. For example, each element can individually have varying orientations, sizes, and display
symbols (IEC or ANSI). The one-line diagram also allows you to place multiple protective devices
between a circuit branch and a bus.
ETAP provides you with a variety of options for presenting or viewing your electrical system. These
views are called presentations. The location, size, orientation, and symbol of each element can be
different in each presentation. Additionally, protective devices and relays can be displayed (visible) or
hidden (invisible) for any particular presentation. For example, one presentation can be a relay view

where all protective devices are displayed. Another presentation may show a one-line diagram with some
circuit breakers shown and the rest hidden (a layout best suited for load flow results).
Among ETAP’s most powerful features are the composite network and motor elements. Composite
elements allow you to graphically nest network elements within themselves to an arbitrary depth. For
example, a composite network can contain other composite networks, providing the capability to
construct complex electrical networks while still maintaining a clean, uncluttered diagram that displays
what you want to emphasize - yet the next level of system detail is within easy reach of your mouse.
Power is at your fingertips.
We consider ETAP to be the foremost-integrated database for electrical systems, allowing you to have
multiple presentations of a system for different analysis or design purposes.

2.3 One-Line Diagrams
ETAP provides a fully graphical editor to construct your one-line diagram. From the One-Line Diagram
Edit toolbar, you can graphically add, delete, undo, redo, move, or connect elements; zoom in or out;
display grid on or off; change element size, orientation, alignment, symbol, or visibility; enter properties;
set operating status; etc.

You can use composite networks and motors with unlimited nesting capabilities to create uncluttered and
easy to follow one-line diagrams.
Composite networks allow up to 20
connections from outside the network,
making them very flexible so they can be
used in a variety of configurations.
Note that the nesting capabilities of a oneline diagram do not affect the calculation
results in any way. Calculation programs
consider all one-line diagram components
nested to any level.

2.5 3-D Database
ETAP uses a 3-D database concept to implement presentations, configurations, and revision data. The use
of this multi-dimensional database concept allows you to independently select a particular presentation,
status configuration, or revision data within the same project database.

•

Presentations
Unlimited, independent graphical presentations of the one-line diagram to represent the one-line
diagrams for any purpose such as impedance diagram, study results, relay diagrams, plot plan,
etc.

•

•

Configurations (Status)
Unlimited, independent system configurations to keep track of the status of switching devices
(open and closed), motors and loads (continuous, intermittent, and spare), MOVs (open, closed,
throttling, and spare).

Revision Data (Engineering Properties)
Base data and unlimited Revision data to keep track of changes and modifications of the
engineering properties (nameplate, settings, etc.) of elements.

These three system components are organized in an orthogonal fashion to provide you with great power
and flexibility in constructing and manipulating your ETAP project. Using the concept of Presentation,
Status Configuration, and Revision Data, you can create numerous combinations of networks of diverse
configurations and varying engineering properties that allow you to fully investigate and study the
behavior and characteristics of the electrical networks using one database. This means that there is no
need to copy your database for different system configurations, ‘what if’ studies, etc.

Graphical

Status
Configuration

Revision Data
These dimensions can be used in conjunction with multiple loading categories and multiple study cases to
quickly and efficiently perform system design and analysis without the possibility of data discrepancies
caused by multiple copies of a single project file being used to account for various system changes.
This powerful new concept is unique to ETAP. A 3-D database vs. a flat database means:
• No need to keep multiple copies of the database
• Eliminate data discrepancies & errors
• Higher capability & flexibility
• Higher productivity
• Less man-hours

2.10 Scenario Wizard
A scenario allows you to group all study options into one place. For this reason, scenarios are useful
anytime you want to record a study to be executed. Every project file contains a Scenario Wizard.
Scenarios are created and recorded in the Scenario Wizard and can be run individually at any time. A
project can have an unlimited number of scenarios. Scenarios are composed of the following parameters:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

System (Network Analysis or CSD Analysis)
Presentation (e.g., one-line diagram, UGS, or CSD)
Revision Data (Base or Revision Data)
Configuration Status (e.g., Normal, Stage 1, or TSEvents)
Study Mode (e.g., Load Flow or Short-Circuit)
Study Case (loading and generation system operation factors and solution parameters)
Study Type (vary depending on Study Mode)
Output Report (vary depending on Study Mode)

When you run a scenario in a project, it will automatically create an output report or overwrite an existing
report with the same name.

Scenario Wizard Editor
You can create a scenario either by selecting parameters in the Scenario Wizard or by recording options
you have already selected for your study in the one-line view.

2.11 Study Wizard
Macros reduce the time it takes to run several scenarios. Every project file contains a Study Wizard. The
Study Wizard enables you to sequentially group existing scenarios into study macros. You must have
created the scenarios you want to include in your study macro before you can create the macro. You
create the scenarios using the Scenario Wizard. (See the Scenario Wizard section above for more
information.)
A project may have an unlimited number of study macros. When you run a study macro, all of the
scenarios included in it are run, creating or overwriting the output reports just as they would if they were
run individually. For example, you could group scenarios related to load flow or a specific type of load
flow into one study macro.

2.12 Project Wizard
The Project Wizard is project independent and is saved within the ETAP folder. It enables the user to
group existing study macros into project macros. You should use a project macro when you have several
projects from which you want to run multiple study macros and their scenarios simultaneously. This
feature automates opening and closing project files and individually executing study macros and their
scenarios.

4. Demo Structure
This section describes the structure of the ETAP 14 Demo package. The demo has been designed to allow
sampling of most of the editing and analysis tools in ETAP.

Select Demo Project Editor
This window is immediately displayed as soon as you run the ETAP 14 Demo program. It gives you the
following options:

New Project
The New Project option allows you to open a new ETAP project where you can build a one-line diagram
from scratch. The system that you build can have as many as twelve AC buses and ten DC buses. You can
perform all enabled analysis on this newly created project, but you cannot save the changes you make.
Please refer to Section 2 for a list of all the studies that you can perform or need to enable using your
Return Key Code.

Example Project (ANSI)
If you select this option, an example project will open which has been setup to run all the available ETAP
modules. The example project contains several links to allow you to view the getting started documents
for ETAP. It also contains valuable information regarding one-line diagrams editing features. In this
project, all symbols and studies are based on ANSI standard.

Example Project (IEC)
If you select this option, an example project will open which has been setup to run all the available ETAP
modules. The example project contains several links to allow you to view the getting started documents
for ETAP. It also contains valuable information regarding one-line diagrams editing features. In this
project, all symbols and studies are based on IEC standard.

T&D Project
If you select this option, a large project file opens which can only be browsed. This project is provided as
an example of larger systems and how they can be divided into subsystems or “composite networks” to
simplify and organize one-line diagrams. This project is a bigger version of the example project. It is very
important to know that ETAP does not have any system size limitations; this means that you can have an
unlimited number of buses.

Note that the operating voltage of Bus1 is 97.94%. This caused the bus to be flagged as
marginally under voltage in the Alert View window. The criteria for which a condition is flagged
can be changed in the Load Flow Study Case editor, which will be discussed in the next lesson.
We will now use the bus voltage regulation feature of the Transformer Editor to change our Load
Flow results.
ETAP allows Auto LTC settings to be applied to regulate buses that are directly or indirectly
connected to a transformer. For example, we can use transformer T4 to regulate Bus1 at 100% of
nominal voltage. Open the editor of T4 by double clicking on its graphic. On the Tap tab, enable
(check) the Auto LTC box on the primary winding.

Open the LTC settings window by clicking on the LTC box and change the Regulated Bus ID to
Bus1. Click OK for both the LTC window and the Transformer Editor window.
Now you can run a Load Flow study again, with attention paid to the operating voltage of Bus1.
Click the Run Load Flow button on the Load Flow toolbar to do so.
Notice that the operating voltage of Bus1 is now within a
tap step of the desired 100% regulation value. This is just
one example of the many features of the ETAP
Load Flow module.

This is the simplest way to get some quick AF results and make labels. The following steps show
how to accomplish this:



ETAP Arc Flash has typical equipment gap and X-factors built into the rating page of the
bus. You can take advantage of these typical values to perform a quick Arc Flash
calculation. Open the editor for Bus1 and go to the rating page of the bus and select the
type of equipment that is represented by that bus. This can be enclosed equipment such as
MCC, switchgear, or open-air equipment, i.e., not enclosed in a box. Once you have
selected the equipment type, select typical gap and boundary values by clicking on the
“Typical Data” button. This will bring all the required gap and x-factor information as
well as approach boundaries as defined by NFPA 70E. To change the Arc Flash Analysis

Go to the Arc Flash page and select the working distance. This distance is automatically
populated based on the voltage level and type of equipment. The working distance is
defined as the distance from the person’s torso and face to the energized equipment
(typically 18 inches for low voltage equipment). You may also define the system
grounding configuration of the equipment feeder, i.e., transformer grounding / source
grounding like solidly grounded or delta. If you do not know the system grounding,
assuming the system is ungrounded will yield conservative results (default). You can
change the default user-defined system grounding by selecting it from the dropdown list.
ETAP can also be configured to automatically determine the system grounding.
Enter the available User-Defined Bolted Fault Current. If you know how long it will take
the protective device to clear the arc, enter this information in the User-Defined Arc Fault
Clearing Time (FCT).

Setting Up and Running a Global Arc Flash Analysis
The previous section described a simple way to generate quick AF results. However, the bus calculator is
simplified and it is not efficient when you need to run an analysis on hundreds of fault locations. For this
you need to setup the global AF calculation.
The same input data is required if you use the quick incident energy calculator at the bus or if the global
AF calculation is used; however, in ETAP there are quicker and easier ways to define the input data
required by the calculation.



Open the Arc Flash calculation study case and go to the AF Data page. In this page you
can globally define the equipment’s gaps between conductors, working distance, and
other AF parameters to be used by the global AF calculation. This will save you a lot of
time since you would be only required to define the type of equipment represented by
each bus. The following image shows the recommended settings for a global AF
calculation:

The global definitions for each set of input data parameters can be modified or reviewed
by accessing the Project \ Settings \ Arc Flash \ menus as shown below:

On the Info page of the Arc Flash Study Case editor, select the buses to be faulted
through the Info as shown in the Short Circuit leaflet. You can also right-click on the bus
and select Fault or Don’t Fault.

Next select the analysis method from the Arc Flash Study Case. This can be either NFPA
70E Annex D.2, D.3 or IEEE 1584. The IEEE method is a more accurate model and is set
as default.

Analysis Capabilities

The next step requires the selection of the arc fault clearing time (FCT). The default is set
to the automatic determination of the FCT from the Star protective device time current
characteristics (TCC) of the protective devices (PD). In most cases, the most conservative
solution is reached by selecting a TCC only for the main feeder PD since they take a
longer time to operate. If you do not select a TCC for the bus, ETAP will use the userdefined FCT from the bus Arc Flash page.
The remaining options to be selected can be left as default and are self explanatory. For
example, you can choose to update the global calculation results back to the Arc Flash
page of the bus.
Once this information has been selected from the bus and Arc Flash page, all you need to
do is to click on the Arc Flash icon from the toolbar to launch the calculation. The
program will provide a full set of reports for all the faulted buses as well as all the labels
for every protective device location and for the faulted buses.

On the Schedule page, the individual panel slots can be filled by clicking on the corresponding
Link box, and selecting an option from the drop-down menu. If you want to connect a slot to an
external element, choose one of the four Ext-X slots. Note connections #2 and #8 are designated
external. The Summary page of the Panel Schedule editor details the total loading on the panel.

If you have a 3-phase panel and would like to attach a 3-phase load to it, you need to change the
number of poles. As a result, three slots are used in the panel.
