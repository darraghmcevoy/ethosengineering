# Engineering Knowledge App Design and Development Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the design and development approach for the Engineering Knowledge App for Graduate Engineers, focusing on standardisations across the industry and practical software guides.

## Design Principles

### User-Centered Design
- Focus on graduate engineers' needs and workflows
- Prioritize quick access to frequently needed information
- Design intuitive navigation for both novice and experienced users
- Ensure all content is accessible and readable on various devices

### Visual Design
- Clean, professional interface with engineering-appropriate aesthetics
- Consistent color scheme and typography throughout the app
- Clear visual hierarchy to guide users through content
- Use of diagrams, illustrations, and visual aids to enhance understanding

### Content Presentation
- Consistent formatting across all sections
- Progressive disclosure of complex information
- Clear headings and subheadings for easy scanning
- Appropriate use of tables, lists, and callouts

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Framework
- React.js for component-based UI development
- Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Material-UI components for consistent interface elements
- Custom styling to match engineering professional context

### Backend Structure
- Node.js server for content delivery
- MongoDB for content storage and management
- RESTful API for content retrieval and search
- Authentication system for potential future premium features

### Search Functionality
- Full-text search across all content
- Filtering by discipline, content type, and keywords
- Autocomplete suggestions for search terms
- Search result ranking based on relevance

## User Interface Components

### Navigation System
- Primary navigation by main categories (Standards, Software Guides, Resources)
- Secondary navigation within each category
- Breadcrumb trail for current location
- Quick access sidebar for frequently used content

### Content Display
- Clean reading panes with appropriate whitespace
- Collapsible sections for long content
- Code snippets with syntax highlighting for software guides
- Interactive diagrams where applicable

### Interactive Elements
- Bookmarking system for saving frequently accessed content
- Note-taking capability for personal annotations
- Progress tracking for tutorials and guides
- Feedback mechanism for content improvement

## Development Phases
