## Content Organization Principles

1. **Consistency**: All content follows a consistent format with clear headings, subheadings, and bullet points for easy scanning.

2. **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is organized from basic to advanced, allowing graduate engineers to build knowledge progressively.

3. **Cross-Referencing**: Related content is linked across sections to help users discover relevant information.

4. **Search Optimization**: Content includes appropriate keywords and tags to facilitate effective searching.

5. **UK English**: All content is written in UK English, including terminology, spelling, and units of measurement.

6. **Visual Elements**: Diagrams, charts, and illustrations are included where appropriate to enhance understanding.

7. **Practical Focus**: Content emphasizes practical application rather than just theoretical knowledge.

8. **Regular Updates**: Structure allows for easy updates as standards and software evolve.

## User Experience Considerations

1. **Quick Access**: Most frequently used content is easily accessible from the main navigation.

2. **Bookmarking**: Users can bookmark frequently accessed content for quick reference.

3. **History**: App maintains a history of recently viewed content for easy navigation.

4. **Offline Access**: Core content is available offline for use in field situations without internet access.

5. **Search Functionality**: Robust search with filters for discipline, content type, and keywords.

6. **Feedback Mechanism**: Users can provide feedback on content for continuous improvement.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Content Format**: All content is stored in structured formats (Markdown, JSON) for easy rendering across devices.

2. **Media Storage**: Images and diagrams are stored separately with appropriate metadata for efficient loading.

3. **Version Control**: Content versioning system tracks changes and updates.

4. **Localization**: While currently in UK English, structure supports potential localization in the future.

5. **Accessibility**: Content structure supports accessibility features including screen readers and text scaling.
