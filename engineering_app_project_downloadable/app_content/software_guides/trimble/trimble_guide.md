   - Use the best positioning technology for each specific task
   - Eliminate the need to switch between multiple software solutions
   - Maintain consistent workflows regardless of instrument type

2. **Import PDFs for Field Layout**
   - Import PDF plans directly into Trimble FieldLink when CAD files aren't available
   - Assign and verify proper scale during the import process
   - Convert PDF line work into usable CAD geometry
   - Perform layout directly from imported PDFs

3. **Add Points to Existing Plans**
   - Add additional points to 2D or 3D models from either the office or field
   - Place points on endpoints, midpoints, circles/arc centres, and intersections
   - Create, name, and use layer control points to keep workflows organised
   - Perform automated layout on any background geometry

4. **Build Digital Plans from Printed Ones**
   - Create digital data from printed plans
   - Use layer management tools to organise information important for layout
   - Share digital data between field and office teams
   - Compare field-created digital plans against original designs

5. **Create Point Patterns**
   - Save time by creating reusable point patterns for common components
   - Create patterns for anchor bolts, column offsets, and other repeating elements
   - Select X and Y values to create grid patterns
   - Drop patterns onto any layout point and rotate to the desired angle

### Collaboration and Data Management

1. **Bridge the Gap Between Office and Field**
   - Share real-time data between design teams and field crews
   - Improve coordination between designers and jobsite personnel
   - Create a feedback loop for continuous improvement
   - Ensure all stakeholders have access to the most current information

2. **Layer Management**
   - Use layers to organise and visualise information
   - Prepare specific layers for field layout crews
   - Share layer information as common FieldLink files
   - Toggle visibility of different layers to focus on specific tasks

3. **Data Integration**
   - Import data from various sources including CAD, BIM, and PDF
   - Export field data for office verification and documentation
   - Create a single source of truth for layout information
   - Maintain data integrity throughout the project lifecycle

3. **Surface Modelling**
   - Create accurate surface models from survey data
   - Calculate volumes and earthwork quantities
   - Generate contours and elevation maps
   - Analyse drainage patterns and watershed boundaries

### Quality Control

1. **Data Validation**
   - Check for errors and inconsistencies in survey data
   - Compare field measurements to design values
   - Identify and resolve discrepancies
   - Document quality control procedures

2. **Adjustment Tools**
   - Perform least squares adjustments on survey networks
   - Analyse adjustment results and error estimates
   - Identify and correct systematic errors

   - Access project information from any device

2. **Model Coordination**
   - Combine models from different disciplines
   - Detect clashes and conflicts between systems
   - Resolve issues before construction begins
   - Visualise the complete project in 3D

3. **Communication Tools**
   - Create and assign tasks to team members
   - Add comments and markups to models and drawings
   - Track issue resolution and decision-making
   - Maintain a record of project communications

### Mobile Access

1. **Field Access to Project Data**
   - View models and drawings on mobile devices
   - Access project information from anywhere
   - Capture field notes and photos
   - Update project status in real-time

2. **Offline Capabilities**
   - Download project files for offline use
   - Work in areas with limited connectivity
   - Synchronise changes when connection is restored
   - Maintain productivity regardless of location

### Modelling Efficiency

1. **Template-Based Modelling**
   - Create and use templates for common structural elements
   - Maintain consistency across projects
   - Accelerate the modelling process
   - Implement company standards in all models

2. **Parametric Components**
   - Create custom parametric components for specialised structures
   - Reuse components across multiple projects
   - Modify parameters to adapt components to different situations
   - Build a library of company-specific components

3. **Model Organisation**
   - Use phases to organise the model by construction sequence
