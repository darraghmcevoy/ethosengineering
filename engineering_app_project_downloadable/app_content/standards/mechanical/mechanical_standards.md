## Best Practices for Graduate Mechanical Engineers

1. Always refer to the latest version of standards as they are regularly updated
2. Maintain a record of all standards used in project documentation
3. Consider both UK-specific standards and international standards where applicable
4. Consult with experienced engineers when interpreting complex standards
5. Join professional bodies like IMechE to stay updated on standards developments
6. Understand the hierarchy of standards (International, European, British, Industry-specific)
7. Be aware of the transition from British Standards to Eurocodes for structural design
